# Agent Guide

This file is for AI agents and automation tools working in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

`published-content` is a portfolio of educational content published on LinkedIn
and YouTube. Content is stored as folders plus metadata files, then surfaced in
a filterable website.

## Content Structure

- LinkedIn content lives in `linkedin/0001`, `linkedin/0002`, ...
- YouTube content lives in `youtube/YYYYMMDD`
- Each content folder should contain:
  - `name.txt` (required)
  - `url.txt` (required, `TODO:` allowed until published)
  - `tags.txt` (required, one tag per line)
  - `Files.zip` (required for downloadable practice files)

## Auto-Generated Files and Sections

Do not manually edit these outputs unless you are updating generator logic.

- `js/data.js` (fully generated by `scripts/generate_index.py`)
- Auto-managed marker sections in `README.md`:
  - `LINKEDIN_COUNT`
  - `YOUTUBE_COUNT`
  - `TOTAL_BADGE_COUNT`
  - `TOTAL_COUNT`
  - `TOPIC_BADGES` block

If you touch marker names, update `scripts/generate_index.py` accordingly.

## Source of Truth

Content folders are the source of truth.

- Counts in README are derived from folder scans.
- Topic badges in README are derived from discovered tags in `tags.txt` files.
- Website content data is derived from folder metadata files.

## Automation Flow

1. You add/update content folders under `linkedin/` or `youtube/`.
2. GitHub Actions runs `.github/workflows/update.yml` on push to `main`.
3. The workflow runs `python scripts/generate_index.py`.
4. The workflow commits any changes to `js/data.js` and `README.md`.

This works even when content is added directly from GitHub web UI.

## Editing Rules for Agents

- Preserve existing design language in `index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/app.js`.
- Keep JavaScript and Python style consistent with existing code.
- Use ASCII unless a file already requires Unicode.
- Avoid introducing breaking changes to marker comments in README.

## Tag Conventions

Current standardized tags:

- `excel`
- `power-query`
- `m-code`
- `formulas`
- `charts`
- `dynamic-arrays`
- `data-analysis`
- `data-cleaning`

New tags are allowed and auto-discovered by the website and README generator.

## Local Validation Checklist

Before committing script changes:

1. Run `python scripts/generate_index.py`
2. Run `ruff check scripts/generate_index.py`
3. Confirm `js/data.js` and README auto-sections update as expected
4. Open `index.html` locally and verify filters/tags/search still work
